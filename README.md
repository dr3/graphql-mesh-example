# graphql-mesh-example

This is a demo of a graphql gateway built with Mesh, using a source of existing REST APIs with swagger documentation. There are two packages in this repo:

## âœ¨ gateway

This is a graphql gateway api, built using Mesh & Envelop.

### How to run
```
yarn workspace gateway start
```

## ðŸ“  rest-api

This is an example REST api. For this demo we can pretend this already existed and is perhaps built by another team. 

## How to run

```
yarn workspace rest-api start
```
